    "# Blackjack with Q-Learning\n",
    "Blackjack is one of the most popular casino card games that is also infamous for being beatable under certain conditions. This version of the game uses an infinite deck (we draw the cards with replacement), so counting cards won’t be a viable strategy in our simulated game. Full documentation can be found at https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/blackjack\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: To win, your card sum should be greater than the dealers without exceeding 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions**: Agents can pick between two actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- stand (0): the player takes no more cards\n",
    "\n",
    "- hit (1): the player will be given another card, however the player could get over 21 and bust\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**: To solve this environment by yourself, you can pick your favorite discrete RL algorithm. The presented solution uses Q-learning (a model-free RL algorithm)."

This function takes an action as input and executes it in the environment. Because that action changes the state of the environment, it returns four useful variables to us. These are:\n",

    "- truncated: This is a boolean variable that also indicates whether the episode ended by early truncation, i.e., a time limit is reached.\n",
    "- info: This is a dictionary that might contain additional information about the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next_state, reward, terminated and truncated variables are self-explanatory, but the info variable requires some additional explanation. This variable contains a dictionary that might have some extra information about the environment, but in the Blackjack-v1 environment you can ignore it. For example in Atari environments the info dictionary has a ale.lives key that tells us how many lives the agent has left. If the agent has 0 lives, then the episode is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is not a good idea to call `env.render()` in your training loop because rendering slows down training by a lot. Rather try to build an extra loop to evaluate and showcase the agent after training."
